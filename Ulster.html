      Standing on top of the magnificent Slieve League cliffs, it feels like you're at the very edge of the world. Hiking towards the summit is rather strenuous but definitely worth it. On a clear day you can see right across to Sligo and Leitrim and all the way to the mountains of the Mayo coast. To reach the highest point of Slieve League, you must take a norrow pathway to One Man's Pass, which is exhilirating and somewhat scary, and only recommended for experienced hikers.
