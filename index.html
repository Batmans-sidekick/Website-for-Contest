        Standing on top of the magnificent Slieve League cliffs, it feels like you're at the very edge of the world. Hiking towards the summit is rather strenuous but definitely worth it. On a clear day you can see right across to Sligo and Leitrim and all the way to the mountains of the Mayo coast. To reach the highest point of Slieve League, you must take a norrow pathway to One Man's Pass, which is exhilirating and somewhat scary, and only recommended for experienced hikers.

      <div class = "par">
       Standing at 925m Lugnaquilla or Lug as it’s better known, is the highest mountain in Ireland outside of Kerry. It’s important to note that if you intend climbing ‘Lug’ you should be fully prepared: know what equipment to carry and know how to use. A major difficulty with climbing the mountain is the summit plateau, this area is very difficult to navigate in poor weather and is a regular cause of walkers getting lost on the mountain. The plateau is also guarded by two areas of cliffs to the North and South.
